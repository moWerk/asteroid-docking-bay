"""The backend op table (see docs/CONTAINERS.md).

Every host-touching operation the web API offers is a named op here. This is
the single implementation of that logic: the monolithic web server dispatches
to it in-process via LocalCaller, and the split backend serves the same table
over RPC. Adding a capability means registering a named op in a reviewable
diff — there is deliberately no generic "run a command" op.

Op names mirror the former /api/* routes. Data handlers take one args dict
and return a JSON-able value (the app-level response, distinct from the RPC
envelope's ok/error). Streaming handlers (flash, onboard) yield raw message
strings — an empty string is a keep-alive heartbeat — which the frontend
turns into SSE frames.
