"""Catching the gap between what a watch is CONFIGURED to do and what it does.

Always-on display is toggled in userland (dconf) and performed by MCE. Those
are two different pieces of state, and nothing has ever compared them: a-d-b
recorded the dconf toggle as a standby "consumer" and took it as fact. If the
toggle is on while MCE was never told, every drain figure attributed to AoD was
attributed to something that was not happening.

So capture BOTH sides and diff them across an action. The bug this exists for
is reported as: after a fresh flash, AoD does not render in low-power mode
until the settings app is opened and closed — after which it works, with the
settings themselves unchanged. Two captures either side of that action say
which layer moved, and therefore which project owns the bug:

  * dconf identical, MCE changed  -> the setting was never PUSHED to MCE at
    boot; opening the page pushes it. A configuration-plumbing bug.
  * both identical                -> not a config discrepancy at all; the
    thing that draws was simply never instantiated. A different bug entirely.

Reading is deliberately side-effect free. The evidence for a boot is destroyed
the moment anything opens the settings app, so this must be safe to run first.
