    A running charge, drain or workbench owns its port's power state, and

    Two views, because there are two kinds of caller. Inside the web service
    the in-memory registries are authoritative and current. A separate CLI
    process sees empty registries — the ops live in another process — so it
    falls through to the durable store, which is the only view it has. One
    function for both keeps the answer identical whoever asks.

    Fails closed: a stale file left by a crashed service refuses an operation
    that would in fact have been safe. That is the right direction to be
