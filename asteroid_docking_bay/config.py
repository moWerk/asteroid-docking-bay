"""Config file I/O, typed settings, and codename/serial/port lookups.

Two layers (beroset's design): ConfigManager owns the file — load, defaults
merge, save, and the lock serializing read-modify-write cycles. The typed
contents are dataclasses: ChargeConfig / FlashConfig carry the settings with
their defaults in one place, so consumers write `charge.low_threshold`
instead of scattering `.get("low_threshold", 40)` fallbacks.

The hubs/serials mappings stay as plain dicts inside the raw config: their
shape is the config *file's* shape (ports, sockets, excludes, per-port
serials), edited in place by map/remap/soft-remap."""
