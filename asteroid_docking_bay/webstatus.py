    This is the plain-laptop-port case, and the first thing a new user sees:
    one watch, no smart hub, plugged straight into the machine. Without this
    view a-d-b sees the watch on ADB and shows an empty table, because every
    row is built by walking the CONFIGURED hubs and an unmapped port is not on
    that walk. The watch appears here the moment it enumerates -- nothing to
    map, nothing to save.

    Also catches a watch on a hub the user has not mapped yet, which is the
    same situation from a-d-b's point of view: something is connected and
    a-d-b can talk to it, but no port owns it.

    Deliberately light, like the Orbit view: everything a physical row carries
    beyond identity -- charge, drain, PPPS, self-heal, port control -- is a
    property of a port that can switch its own power, which by definition this
    one cannot. `smart` is False for exactly that reason, so the UI renders it
    as an always-on socket rather than pretending a control exists.

    Reads no hardware: identity comes from config and the last-seen cache, so
    a plugged-in unknown watch cannot slow the refresh down. Naming an unknown
    watch is the guided setup's job (it can afford the blocking ADB read), not
    this function's.

    Returns None when nothing qualifies. Orbit is emitted empty because its
    header carries the launch-by-IP box; this section has no control of its
    own, so an always-present empty one would be noise.
