"""Host side of wanze — the probe that records while the watch is away.

wanze samples opportunistically: its timer never wakes the watch, so rows
appear only when the watch was awake anyway. Everything here exists to read
that irregular trace honestly.

Two hazards drive the whole design, both found on live hardware:

* **The watch's wall clock cannot be trusted.** catfish's RTC was 130 DAYS
  behind the host while recording perfectly well. So `epoch` is useless on its
  own, and every timing conclusion is drawn from `uptime` instead, which no
  clock adjustment can move. The skew is measured at harvest and reported
  rather than silently corrected.
* **A gap is data, not a hole.** The probe not firing for three hours means the
  watch slept for three hours. Treating that as missing data throws away the
  one thing a wearable telemetry probe is uniquely able to measure.

Sensor classification is deliberately NOT reimplemented here: the rows carry
the same keys drainlog already understands, so `drainlog.classify` handles the
per-watch sign convention and the always-zero case for both.
