def test_a_docked_wifi_watch_is_mirrored_into_orbit(monkeypatch):
    """A watch on WiFi stays reachable when its cable does not, so mirror it
    into Orbit while it is still docked: the row then says "in orbit" instead
    of "not enumerating", and everything that does not need a cable keeps
    working after USB drops.

    Three gates, each of which would otherwise produce a mirror that lies:

    1. It must have a MAPPED PORT. A mirror is a claim about a watch that
       belongs to this rig and is coming back to its cradle; without the gate
       the Orbit section fills with whatever else answers on the network.
    2. The address must answer FROM HERE. A watch reporting a WiFi address is
       not the same as this host reaching it -- different subnet, AP isolation,
       a stale lease -- and an unreachable mirror is worse than none, because
       the row claims reachability it does not have.
    3. One watch per pass. Each attempt costs an ADB read and a TCP probe, and
       a docked watch will still be docked in five seconds.
