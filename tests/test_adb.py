# ── battery_and_screen: parsing + the shell-quoting regression guard ──────────
#
# battery_and_screen packs battery + mce demo-mode state into one round-trip.
# The pipeline (`... | head; echo; mcetool | grep`) MUST run on the watch, not
# the host: _run uses shell=True, so an unquoted command has the host shell
# parse the pipes/semicolons and run `mcetool` on the *host* (where it doesn't
# exist), silently returning (None, False) — a stuck screen that reads "fine".
# This shipped once and was caught only on hardware; the quoting test pins it.
