## Hub 1: ALCOR 05e3:0606 "USB Hub 2.0" (×4 units)
**Product:** Generic 4-port USB 2.0 hub, AliExpress item 1005006068027297
**VID:PID:** `05e3:0606`  — note: `lsusb` misidentifies this as "D-Link DUB-H4"; actual DUB-H4 is `05e3:0608`
**USB descriptor:** iManufacturer: `ALCOR` · iProduct: `USB Hub 2.0`
**Ports:** 4 · **USB version:** 2.0

### Verdict: data-line disconnect only — NOT true VBUS switching

uhubctl marks all four units as `ppps`. Port state transitions (on→off→on) work correctly
and exit 0. However, VBUS (5V) stays live on the physical pin even when the port reports
`0000 off`. USB data lines are disconnected (ADB drops, device disappears from enumeration),
but connected watches continue charging.

**How the false positive happened:** Issue #664 was filed after testing on an *empty* port
— state transitions looked correct because there was no device to observe charging. Real VBUS
testing requires a device connected and actively checking the charging indicator. Issue closed
after discovering watches charge continuously regardless of port state.

**Useful for:** ADB operations (reboot, bootloader, flash) — need data lines only.
**Not useful for:** any battery/charge management.

**uhubctl topology:**
```
hub 1-1 [05e3:0606 ALCOR USB Hub 2.0, USB 2.00, 4 ports, ppps]
hub 1-2 [05e3:0606 ALCOR USB Hub 2.0, USB 2.00, 4 ports, ppps]
hub 1-3 [05e3:0606 ALCOR USB Hub 2.0, USB 2.00, 4 ports, ppps]
hub 1-6 [05e3:0606 ALCOR USB Hub 2.0, USB 2.00, 4 ports, ppps]
```

## Hub 2: Manhattan MondoHub II (28-port)
**Product:** Manhattan MondoHub II, 28-port USB 2.0 hub with physical per-port rocker switches
**Internal structure:** compound device — VIA Labs VL813 root cascading into 6 Huasheng sub-hubs

**VID:PIDs:**
- `2109:2813` — VIA Labs, Inc. USB2.0 Hub (root, 4 ports, **ppps**)
- `214b:7250` — Huasheng Electronics USB2.0 HUB (sub-hubs, 4 ports each, **ganged**)

**uhubctl topology:**
```
hub 1-3 [2109:2813 VIA Labs, Inc. USB2.0 Hub, USB 2.10, 4 ports, ppps]
  Port 2: 0503 power highspeed enable connect
    [214b:7250 USB2.0 HUB, USB 2.00, 4 ports, ganged]  ← ×6 cascaded Huasheng sub-hubs
```

### What works: group switching via VIA Labs root

Switching port 2 of the VIA root (`1-3 -p 2`) powers the entire 28-port cascade on or off.
Devices downstream reappear on ADB after power restore.

### What does NOT work: individual port switching

The Huasheng sub-hubs are **ganged** — per-port switching is not possible in software.
The physical rocker switches on the MondoHub II front panel are mechanical only and
cannot be replicated via uhubctl.

### Verdict on VBUS: CONFIRMED data-line only (2026-07-02)

Both levels tested:
- Individual ports (Huasheng sub-hubs, ganged): no effect at all — no switching possible
- Group switch (VIA Labs root, `uhubctl -l 1-3 -p 2 -a off`): data-line disconnect only —
  VBUS stays live, watch continues charging

The VIA Labs `2109:2813` chip in this product does NOT cut VBUS despite being marked ppps.
Same failure mode as the ALCOR hubs.

**Note:** `2109:2813` is already in the uhubctl list (Aukey CB-C59, AmazonBasics U3-7HUB).
Issue #665 was filed to add Manhattan MondoHub II as another product on the same chip.

## uhubctl permissions on w541

Running as user `mo` (systemd user service, no sudo):
- sysfs path (`/sys/bus/usb/devices/.../disable`) requires root → Permission denied
- uhubctl falls back to libusb automatically, exit code 0, switching works
- Spurious warning was going to stderr → silenced by adding `-S` flag (commit f69379d)
- Full udev sysfs rules are in `udev/70-asteroid-docking-bay.rules` (05e3 line commented)

## What to buy for true VBUS switching

Reference: https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl#compatible-usb-hubs

Known good:
- **Yepkit YKUSH** — explicit per-port VBUS control, confirmed working
- **Acroname USB 3.1** — gold standard, expensive
- Via Labs / Terminus USB 3 hubs — check list; some (not all) do true VBUS
