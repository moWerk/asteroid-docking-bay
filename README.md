# asteroid-docking-bay

A dashboard and CLI for keeping a collection of [AsteroidOS](https://asteroidos.org)
smartwatches charged and healthy while they sit in a drawer.

If you are an AsteroidOS user you tend to accumulate watches, and their 2014–2018
batteries don't store well. Powered off, a worn cell drains flat within weeks
(one "powered off at 100%" is empty months later), and a flat cell often gets
stuck in the low-charge reboot loop. Left on a powered dock instead, it sits
pegged at 100%, which is also hard on the cell.

This keeps them docked on smart USB hubs and cycles each battery to stay
around 40–80%. Port power is switched by writing the kernel's per-port
`disable` attribute in sysfs, which stays fast even on deep hub cascades
([uhubctl](https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl) is used for discovery and as a
fallback).

What it does:

- A web dashboard for the fleet: port power, connection state, OS detection,
  battery, and running operations, and it tracks watches you move between
  ports. When a watch drops off the bus its last-known readings stay on
  screen — marked stale, with a "last live" age — instead of blanking. Every
  row is compact by design: a battery *gauge* that fills by charge level, a
  row of status *dots*, and a single **menu** hold all the actions. Click a
  watch to open a Control Center that reads its telemetry and controls its
  hardware (WiFi, Bluetooth, screen, buzz-to-find, clock sync, screenshots).
- **Works over ADB *or* SSH.** Every watch feature works the same whether a
  watch is on ADB or in SSH/developer USB mode — the tool picks whichever wire
  answers. You can switch a watch's USB mode from the dashboard, run several
  watches on SSH at once (each gets its own address, so they never collide on
  the default `192.168.2.15`), and set a fleet-wide **prefer ADB / prefer SSH**
  policy that quietly keeps stray watches on the mode you chose.
- Watch identity, exactly: each row shows the watch's product photo and its
  precise hardware codename — even for variants that share a factory image (a
  TicWatch E2 reads as `tunny`, not the `skipjack` image it actually ships),
  resolved from the screen resolution. Click the photo to see the watch with
  its **live screen composited inside it**.
- Battery care: charge one or several watches at once to a target rather than
  on a timer, a sustain job every 12 hours, and a workbench mode that keeps a
  watch in-band while you work on it over WiFi/SSH.
- Battery triage: standby drain tests with saved history, surfaced as a
  wearability dot in each row, to see which watches still hold a day of standby
  and which are battery-swap candidates worth keeping only as dock-powered dev
  units.
- Fleet flashing: fetch, checksum, and flash AsteroidOS nightlies to every
  docked watch at once.

## How it works

1. Watches are physically connected to smart USB hubs that support per-port
   power control.
2. The `asteroid-docking-bay` CLI switches hub port power (via sysfs, as
   above; `uhubctl` for discovery and as a fallback) and talks to the watches
   over `adb`.
3. A systemd user timer fires every 12 hours, powers each watch on, checks
   the battery over ADB, charges it to 80% if below 40%, then powers the
   port back off.

Battery level is read from the watch's `power_supply` class over ADB shell,
preferring the named hardware fuel gauge (`nanohub_fuelgauge-*/capacity`)
over the generic `battery` node where present — on some watches the generic
node is a separate, miscalibrated source. This is the standard Linux
power-supply class; `dumpsys` and `getprop` are Android-only and not
available on AsteroidOS.

## Requirements

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Python 3 | ≥ 3.9 | stdlib only; `python-systemd` optional for journald |
| [uhubctl](https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl) | any recent | for hub power control |
| adb | any | `android-tools` or `android-sdk-platform-tools` |
| fastboot | any | required for `flash`; same package as adb |
| wget | any | required for `flash` nightly downloads |
| [bottle](https://bottlepy.org/) | any recent | optional; required for `serve` (web UI) |

### Installing dependencies

**Arch Linux**
```sh
sudo pacman -S android-tools
yay -S uhubctl   # AUR
sudo pacman -S python-bottle   # optional, for the web UI
```

**Debian / Ubuntu**
```sh
sudo apt install uhubctl android-tools-adb
pip install bottle   # optional, for the web UI
```

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/moWerk/asteroid-docking-bay.git
cd asteroid-docking-bay
./install.sh
```

The binary is installed to `~/.local/bin/asteroid-docking-bay`. The systemd
user units go to `~/.config/systemd/user/`.

`~/.local/bin` must be on your `PATH` for the short form to work. Most
distros add it automatically; if yours doesn't (the installer will warn you):
```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"   # add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
```

### Rootless setup (recommended)

By default uhubctl requires root. To run without sudo:

1. Find your hub's USB vendor ID:
   ```sh
   lsusb | grep -i hub
   # or
   uhubctl -l
   ```

2. Edit `udev/70-asteroid-docking-bay.rules` to uncomment the line matching
   your hub's vendor ID. Lenovo (`17ef`) and Realtek RTS5411 (`0bda`, common
   in 16-port hubs) are enabled by default and confirmed to do true per-port
   VBUS switching.

3. Install the rules:
   ```sh
   sudo cp udev/70-asteroid-docking-bay.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
   sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger --action=add
   # verify (no sudo): uhubctl -l   should now list your hub
   ```
   The rules grant access via `TAG+="uaccess"` (active local login seat) and
   `GROUP="users"` (for SSH/headless access). If your user is not in the
   `users` group, add yourself with `sudo usermod -aG users $USER` and log
   back in, or change the group in the rules file to one you are in. Earlier
   versions used `plugdev`, which many distros (Arch, EndeavourOS, Fedora) do
   not create, so the rule silently did nothing; `users` is the safer default.

   If a hub that is already plugged in does not pick up access after the
   trigger, unplug and replug its upstream cable once.

   The same rules file also grants your `users` group **write** access to each
   hub port's sysfs `disable` attribute, which is what enables near-instant
   port switching (otherwise the tool falls back to slow `uhubctl`). The same
   `udevadm trigger` above applies it. Verify:
   ```sh
   ls -l /sys/bus/usb/devices/*:1.0/*-port*/disable   # group 'users', -rw-rw-r--
   ```
   On startup the tool logs `Port switching: sysfs (instant)` when this is
   active, or `uhubctl fallback (slow)` if the attribute is still read-only.

4. For ADB access (if not already configured):
   ```sh
   # Arch:
   sudo pacman -S android-udev
   # Other: copy udev/70-asteroid-docking-bay.rules and uncomment the ADB line
   ```

## Quick start

```sh
# Step 1: one-time hub setup — discovers hubs and tests per-port power switching
asteroid-docking-bay map

# Step 2: verify everything looks right
asteroid-docking-bay status

# Step 3: enable the automatic charging timer
systemctl --user enable --now asteroid-docking-bay-charge.timer
```

After the initial `map`, the **web UI handles everything else** — plugging in a
new watch, moving a watch to a different port, or adding a watch to a previously
empty slot. Click **Refresh** on any empty port row to detect and configure the
watch automatically (reads the codename from the device, tests PPPS, updates
config). No CLI intervention needed for day-to-day use.

## Commands

```
asteroid-docking-bay status
```
Show all configured watches with hub port, power state, ADB reachability, and
battery percentage.

```
asteroid-docking-bay on  <codename|all>
asteroid-docking-bay off <codename|all>
```
Power a port on or off. `off all` asks for confirmation unless `--force` is
passed.

```
asteroid-docking-bay cycle <codename|all> [--wait SEC]
```
Power off a port, wait (default: 5 s), power back on. Useful to hard-reset a
stuck watch.

```
asteroid-docking-bay charge <codename|all> [--duration MIN]
```
Manual one-time charge cycle: power on → wait for ADB → charge to
`high_threshold` (polling the battery, capped by `charge_max_minutes`) →
power off. `--duration MIN` forces a timed charge instead; watches whose
battery can't be read fall back to `charge_duration_minutes`.

```
asteroid-docking-bay check-charge
```
Periodic charge logic (same as what the timer runs). Safe to run manually for
testing. For each configured watch: wakes it, checks battery, and if below
`low_threshold` charges it to `high_threshold` before powering off.

With `adaptive_cadence` enabled (default), a watch is only woken once its
observed standby drain — learned from past readings — projects it near
`low_threshold`, so a watch that barely self-discharges gets checked rarely
while a leaky one gets checked often. Watches with no drain history yet are
always checked. Run the timer more frequently (e.g. hourly) to let this
adapt; watches that are not due are skipped cheaply without being powered on.

```
asteroid-docking-bay map
```
One-time hub setup wizard:
1. Discovers all connected smart hubs.
2. Powers each port on in sequence and identifies the watch via ADB.
3. **Tests per-port power switching (PPPS)** with a live toggle (up to ~30 s
   per port — see `test-ports` below for what is verified).
4. Saves hub topology, port assignments, and serial numbers to config.

Run once when you first connect a hub, and again only if the hub itself
moves to a different USB port on the host. Adding or moving watches between
ports does not require re-running `map` — use **Refresh** in the web UI instead.
The switching test can be run independently with `test-ports`.

```
asteroid-docking-bay test-ports [codename]
```
Re-test per-port power switching for all configured ports (or a specific watch).
Updates the config and reports the verdict per port. Run this after moving a
watch to a different hub port, or if you skipped the test during `map`.

The test verifies that VBUS is **actually cut**, not just that the hub's
status register toggles (many hubs ACK the command while power stays live).
Evidence, strongest first: the device dropping off ADB within seconds of the
cut; if it keeps responding, the watch itself is asked whether it still sees
external power. Verdicts are three-way:

- `SMART` — VBUS cut confirmed by a live device
- `NOT SMART` — the device demonstrably kept external power through "off"
- `UNVERIFIED` — no device on the port to test against (empty port, or a
  watch that can't enumerate); re-run once a working watch is attached

A definitive verdict therefore requires a booted, ADB-visible watch on the
port. Expect up to ~30 s per port.

```
asteroid-docking-bay discover
```
Scan for ADB-connected watches and print their codename and serial. Useful for
finding serials after a new watch is connected.

```
asteroid-docking-bay serve [--host HOST] [--port PORT]
```
Start the web UI (requires `pip install bottle`). Serves a live status page at
`http://HOST:PORT/` (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`).

Each configured watch is shown as a table row. **Empty port rows** (no watch
assigned) show a **Refresh** button that triggers a full per-port remap: powers
the port on, waits for a watch, reads its codename, tests PPPS, and updates
config — all streamed live into an inline log below the row.

**Mapped watch rows** read left to right in the order state actually flows —
the port, its controls, the connection, the watch, its stats, battery, and
actions. Almost everything lives *in the row*:

- **Port** — the socket/port label (`s1 p1`) with the **ON / OFF** power toggle
  in front of it. The toggle shows an animated *EXEC* state while a switch is in
  flight and settles into the confirmed state.
- **Smart** — the port's per-port-power-switching verdict as a pill: `ppps`
  when the port can switch its own VBUS, `NO!` when it can't, or a **⟳ cycle**
  button when it hasn't been tested — clicking it power-cycles the port and
  fills in the verdict (the cycle *is* the test).
- **Connection** — an **ADB** or **SSH** badge (each carries the watch's
  address and opens the **Network Center** on click), a **fastboot** badge in
  the bootloader, or an honest off-the-bus state: `no link`, `shelved` (a
  confirmed graceful power-down), `booting up` / `boot failed?` after a boot
  attempt, or `reconnecting` after a power cycle.
- **Watch** — the product photo and codename; a disconnected watch's name dims
  so the connected ones stand out. Click the **codename** for the **Control
  Center**, the **photo** for the composited live screen.
- **Stats** — a row of dots: a **power** dot (green = powered, grey = shelved,
  orange = ambiguous) that also opens a short power menu, a **wearability** dot
  from the last drain test (click for drain-test / wear actions), a
  **battery-graph** dot, and a conditional **charge** dot (charging / full /
  discharging). The battery-related dots all open the same **Battery Info**
  panel; a "last live" age trails as plain text when the watch is off the bus.
- **Battery** — a fixed-width **gauge** that fills by charge level. The outline
  is grey; the fill is coloured (red / amber / green) only when the watch is
  connected and the charge state is real — offline it shows the last level in
  grey, a level without a colour claim. Click it for **Battery Info**.
- **Actions** — one **menu** pill, opening a single panel with every action
  grouped and labelled: **Wear**, **Power** (Charge / Drain test / Power off /
  Reboot / Bootloader), **Flashing** (Backup / Restore / Fastboot report /
  Flash nightly / 2.1 / 2.0), **Workbench**, and **Refresh** (re-identify /
  power on). A watch in the bootloader gets the fastboot-appropriate power
  group instead.

Empty port rows keep an **Onboard** button (the streamed remap above).

The charge, drain and workbench operations in detail:
- **Charge** — charges to `high_threshold` (shown live as `64% → 80%`), polling
  the battery every 2 minutes and stopping exactly at the target (capped by
  `charge_max_minutes`). Watches whose battery can't be read fall back to a
  fixed `charge_duration_minutes` countdown. If a charging watch starts
  *losing* charge — dirty contacts, bad cable, failing port — the battery cell
  flags it instead of pretending to charge. **Stop charge** is available while
  it runs.
- **Drain test** — standby battery drain measurement: powers the port off and
  lets the watch run on battery, waking it every 30 minutes for a reading until
  it reaches 15% or you press **Stop test**. The battery cell shows the current
  level, drain rate (%/h) and estimated time to the floor. Results are saved as
  JSON to `~/.local/share/asteroid-docking-bay/drain-tests/`, and the **drain
  history** link in the page header lists every recorded test — per-watch drain
  rate, estimated 100→15% standby life, and a wearability verdict. A rate that
  rises across months means battery wear. Each watch's latest verdict shows
  permanently as its Stats **wearability dot**: wearable when the estimate is at
  least `wearable_min_hours` (default 24 h) of standby, a battery-swap candidate
  otherwise; grey until the watch has ever been tested.
- **Workbench** — check a watch out for hands-on work. The rig powers it up and
  holds its battery in the low–high band for the whole session: charge to
  `high_threshold`, rest with the port off, re-check every
  `workbench_poll_minutes`, charge again at `low_threshold` — instead of a
  powered dock pegging the watch at 100% while you work. Do your work over
  WiFi/SSH (the USB link drops during rest phases); the rig's brief battery
  reads don't interfere. If the battery can't be read (USB switched to SSH
  mode), it falls back to a blind duty cycle of `workbench_blind_charge_minutes`
  of power per rest period. **Return** puts the watch back into the normal
  fleet, already inside the band. Charge, drain and flash actions refuse while a
  watch is checked out.
- **Flash nightly** — full nightly flash streamed live into the inline log.

**Control Center, Battery Info, Network Center.** Click a watch's **codename**
for the **Control Center** — a live, host-side mirror of the watch's About page
and quick settings, read in a single batch: system (kernel, Qt, SoC, CPU clock,
uptime, boot reason, memory, storage, screen resolution, and the flashed
**machine image**, which names the real image behind a shared-image variant),
plus quick controls. From it you can toggle **WiFi / Bluetooth**, **Buzz** the
watch (vibrate to find it in a full dock), force its **Screen** on, grab a
**Screenshot**, and **Sync** its clock + timezone from the host. Session actions
run in the watch's `ceres` user session, not as root.

Two details have their own panels, reachable straight from the row:

- **Battery Info** — the battery gauge, or any of the Stats battery dots. Charge,
  health, technology, voltage, **real charge/discharge current in mA**,
  temperature, cycle count, and USB-input voltage (confirms the port is actually
  delivering power, not just switched on), with the **battery-history chart** at
  its foot.
- **Network Center** — the ADB / SSH badge. WiFi, IP, traffic, Bluetooth, the
  connected companion phone, the watch's **USB IP**, and the **USB-mode switch**.

**Any wire — ADB or SSH.** Every one of these — the Control Center, the
toggles, screenshots, time-sync, even a graceful power-off — works whether the
watch is on **ADB** or in **SSH/developer** USB mode; the tool reaches it over
whichever link answers. Switch a watch between modes from the Network Center (or
the workbench menu). Because every developer-mode watch defaults to the same
`192.168.2.15`, the tool hands each watch its own sticky SSH address (starting at
`192.168.13.37`), set over ADB before the switch, so several watches can run SSH
at once without colliding. A top-bar **prefer ADB / prefer SSH** toggle sets the
fleet policy: a watch that self-enumerates in the "wrong" mode on the shared
address is quietly corrected — returned to ADB, or relocated to its own SSH IP.

The Connection column carries the AsteroidOS logo inside the **ADB** / **SSH**
badge when the watch is running AsteroidOS; other watches show their detected OS
instead (e.g. `WearOS`) — handy for mixed collections that dock non-AsteroidOS
watches for battery care.

**Physical moves are followed automatically for booted watches.** Every
status refresh compares each ADB-online watch's real hub port (from sysfs)
against the config; when a watch has demonstrably moved — relocated to
another port, or swapped with another watch — the mapping updates itself
within one refresh cycle. Only booted, ADB-visible watches can be followed:
relocating a powered-off watch still needs a click on **Refresh** at its new
port. Each port also remembers the exact serial last seen there, so two
units of the same codename never answer for each other.

Charge, drain and workbench state live in the server, not the browser —
reloading the page (or opening it from another machine) picks up running
operations and their countdowns. They also survive a service restart, crash
or reboot: each running operation is persisted to
`~/.local/state/asteroid-docking-bay/tasks/` and resumed automatically when
the service comes back (a drain test keeps its readings and start time, a
charge continues toward its target). On ports recorded as not power-switchable
the power toggle and the Charge / Drain menu items are disabled (Refresh, the
watch actions and Flash still work — they only need a data connection).

The page auto-refreshes every 15 seconds. `--host 0.0.0.0` makes it
reachable from other machines on the network — if your distro runs a
firewall, open the port first (firewalld:
`sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent && sudo firewall-cmd --reload`).
If the port is taken, `--port` picks another; the systemd unit is overridden
via `systemctl --user edit asteroid-docking-bay-web.service`.

For persistent background operation, use the included systemd service:
```sh
# One-time setup
pip install bottle
systemctl --user enable --now asteroid-docking-bay-web.service
# → http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

```
asteroid-docking-bay flash [codename|all] [--local DIR] [--dry-run]
                                [--force-download] [--download-dir DIR]
```
Flash AsteroidOS nightlies to all configured watches (or a single codename) in
sequence, fully automated:

1. Downloads `asteroid-{codename}-boot.img` and
   `asteroid-image-{codename}.rootfs.ext4` from
   `release.asteroidos.org/nightlies/{codename}/` and verifies SHA512. Already-
   downloaded files that pass the checksum are reused without re-downloading.
2. Powers on the hub port.
3. Waits for ADB. If the watch answers at `192.168.2.15` instead (SSH/RNDIS
   mode rather than ADB mode), it prints a prompt to switch to ADB mode in
   Settings → USB on the watch, then waits again.
4. `adb reboot bootloader`
5. Waits for a fastboot device to appear.
6. `fastboot flash userdata` + `fastboot flash boot` + `fastboot continue`
7. Removes stale `192.168.2.15` and `watch` entries from `~/.ssh/known_hosts`
   so the next SSH session isn't blocked by a key mismatch.

`--dry-run` prints the fastboot commands without executing them.  
`--local DIR` uses pre-built images from a local directory instead of
downloading.  
`--force-download` re-downloads even if the cached copy passes SHA512.  
`--download-dir DIR` overrides the default cache location
(`~/.local/share/asteroid-docking-bay/nightlies/`).

## Typical status output

```
WATCH             PORT            POWER  SMART  ADB             BATTERY
nemo              1-1:p1          ON     yes    device          67%
sparrow           1-1:p2          OFF    yes    --              --
dory              1-1:p3          ON     NO!    unauthorized    --
beluga            2-3.4:p2        ON     ?      offline         --
```

SMART column values:
- `yes` — per-port power switching confirmed by live test
- `NO!` — confirmed NOT switchable; on/off/cycle/charge have no effect
- `?`   — not yet tested; run `test-ports` to check

ADB states:
- `device` — fully authorized and online
- `unauthorized` — authorize the ADB connection on the watch screen
- `offline` — USB connected but ADB not yet ready (still booting, or sleeping)
- `--` — port is powered off or watch not recognized

## Configuration

Config is stored at `~/.config/asteroid-docking-bay/config.json`.
See `config.example.json` in this repo for a fully-annotated example.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `low_threshold` | `40` | Charge if battery is below this % |
| `high_threshold` | `80` | Power off if battery is at or above this % |
| `charge_duration_minutes` | `30` | Blind-mode charge duration (battery unreadable) |
| `charge_max_minutes` | `240` | Hard cap for a charge-to-target cycle |
| `wearable_min_hours` | `24` | Estimated standby (100→15%) above which a watch counts as wearable |
| `workbench_poll_minutes` | `30` | Workbench rest-phase re-check interval |
| `workbench_blind_charge_minutes` | `15` | Workbench charge burst per rest period when the battery is unreadable |
| `adb_wait_seconds` | `15` | Seconds between ADB availability retries |
| `adb_wait_retries` | `8` | Max retries (total wait: wait_seconds × retries) |
| `check_interval_hours` | `12` | Documentation only — actual interval is set in the systemd timer |
| `adaptive_cadence` | `true` | Skip waking a watch during check-charge until its observed standby drain projects it near `low_threshold`; watches with no drain history are always checked |
| `adaptive_margin_pct` | `10` | Adaptive cadence wakes a watch when projected to reach `low_threshold` + this |
| `adaptive_max_interval_days` | `14` | Adaptive cadence never skips a watch longer than this |
| `flash.nightly_url` | `https://release.asteroidos.org/nightlies` | Base URL for nightly image downloads |
| `flash.download_dir` | `~/.local/share/asteroid-docking-bay/nightlies` | Local cache for downloaded images |

The `check_interval_hours` field does **not** drive scheduling. Edit
`~/.config/systemd/user/asteroid-docking-bay-charge.timer` to change the
interval, then reload: `systemctl --user daemon-reload`.

## Systemd units

```sh
# Enable and start
systemctl --user enable --now asteroid-docking-bay-charge.timer

# Check status / last run
systemctl --user status asteroid-docking-bay-charge.timer
systemctl --user status asteroid-docking-bay-charge.service

# View logs

# ExecStart=
# ExecStart=%h/.local/bin/asteroid-docking-bay serve --port 9090
```

## Hardware notes

### Watches that require a physical power button press

Some AsteroidOS watches auto-boot when USB power is applied. Others require a
physical power button press. This tool cannot automate the latter — it will
power on the port, then wait for ADB, and log a warning with instructions if
the watch doesn't appear. You will need to press the button manually.

Known behavior by codename is not tracked here; check your watch's hardware
documentation or the AsteroidOS porting guide.

### Hub PPPS: data-line disconnect vs true VBUS switching

`uhubctl` marks a hub as `ppps` (per-port power switching) if it responds
to power commands. There are two very different hardware behaviours hiding
behind this label:

**True VBUS switching** — the hub physically gates the 5 V supply rail.
The watch loses both USB data and charging current. This is required for
battery management (the charge timer is useless without it).

**Data-line disconnect only** — the hub disconnects D+/D− so the device
stops enumerating on USB (`adb devices` drops, port shows `0000 off`), but
VBUS stays live and the watch keeps charging. This is what many cheap hubs
do, including ALCOR 05e3:0606 units.

`test-ports` distinguishes these automatically: it requires the device to
actually drop off the bus (or to report loss of external power over ADB)
before recording a port as smart — a toggling status register alone is not
accepted as evidence. To check manually: switch a port off with `uhubctl`,
then check whether the watch is still charging. If it is, the hub only
controls data lines.

Data-line-only hubs are still useful for ADB operations (flash, reboot,
bootloader) since those require a live USB data connection. They cannot
stop or control charging.

The [uhubctl compatible devices list](https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl#compatible-usb-hubs)
notes which hubs do true VBUS switching.

### Identifying smart hub ports

After `uhubctl -l` shows your hub location (e.g. `1-1`), plug in one watch at
a time and use `asteroid-docking-bay discover` to identify which serial
appeared. Then use `asteroid-docking-bay map` to assign the codename.

Alternatively, `uhubctl -l 1-1 -p 2 -a off` powers off port 2 on hub `1-1`;
if a watch disappears from `adb devices`, you have the right port.

### Multiple hubs

`uhubctl` identifies hubs by their USB location string (e.g. `1-1`, `2-3.4`).
These strings are stable as long as you plug hubs into the same physical ports.
If you rearrange cables, re-run `asteroid-docking-bay map`.

## Development

The code lives in the `asteroid_docking_bay/` package;
`bin/asteroid-docking-bay` is a thin launcher.
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) maps the modules, the
dependency rules, and which parts are classes. There is a ~290-test suite:
the pure logic (parsers, drain math, the charge alarm, the transport and op
tables), plus a headless-DOM harness that runs the web page's own JavaScript
under Node so column order, click wiring and each pill/dot/gauge is checked
without a browser. New behaviour is *planted-bug validated* — a test is only
trusted after it has failed against a deliberately reintroduced copy of the bug
it guards.

```sh
pytest
```

Anything that touches a hub or a watch is verified on real hardware
instead — see the release notes for what that means in practice.

### Container split (experimental)

For a network-exposed deployment the web UI can run as an unprivileged
frontend container that talks to a separate, host-touching backend over a
token-gated socket — so a compromise of the exposed HTTP surface cannot
reach the USB devices or config. The design and threat model are in
[docs/CONTAINERS.md](docs/CONTAINERS.md); the pieces live under
`containers/` (Containerfiles + podman quadlets).

```sh
containers/build.sh                       # build both images
python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))' \
  | podman secret create adb-token -      # shared token
cp containers/adb-*.container containers/adb-*.network \
  ~/.config/containers/systemd/           # install quadlets
systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user start adb-frontend
```

The backend needs USB + sysfs access and the host's adb server; the exact
rootless-podman device/group directives are noted in the quadlet and may
need tuning per host. The single-process `serve` remains the default for
bare-metal installs. This split is new in 0.5 and still being trialled.

## Uninstall

```sh
./install.sh --uninstall
```

This removes the binary and systemd units. Config and serial mappings at
`~/.config/asteroid-docking-bay/` are preserved. Remove manually with
`rm -rf ~/.config/asteroid-docking-bay/`.
