# asteroid-docking-bay

Fleet manager for [AsteroidOS](https://asteroidos.org) smartwatches —
because you can only wear one at a time.

Anyone who flashes AsteroidOS tends to accumulate watches, and their
2014–2018-era batteries spend most of their lives in a drawer: either
drained flat (worn cells lose charge fast — a watch "powered off at 100%"
is still empty months later) or pegged at 100% on a permanently powered
dock. Both abuse aging cells, and deep discharge feeds the notorious
low-charge panic-reboot loop.

asteroid-docking-bay keeps the whole collection docked on smart USB hubs
(per-port power switching via [uhubctl](https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl))
and sustains every battery in a healthy mid-range band (40–80% by default)
— always boot-ready, never trickle-cooked:

- **Web dashboard** for the whole fleet: per-port power, ADB and OS
  detection, battery state, live operations — and it follows physically
  relocated watches automatically.
- **Battery care**: charge-to-target instead of charging by the clock, a
  periodic sustain timer, and a workbench mode that holds the band while
  you do hands-on work on a watch over WiFi/SSH.
- **Battery triage**: standby drain tests with history — measure which
  watches still hold a day of standby (wearable ⌚) and which are
  battery-swap candidates best kept as dock-sustained dev units (🪫).
- **Fleet flashing**: download, verify, and flash AsteroidOS nightlies to
  every docked watch in one command — build-testing on real hardware
  across every codename you own instead of waiting for user error reports.

## How it works

1. Watches are physically connected to smart USB hubs that support per-port
   power control.
2. The `asteroid-docking-bay` CLI controls hub port power via `uhubctl` and
   communicates with watches via `adb`.
3. A systemd user timer fires every 12 hours, powers each watch on, checks
   the battery over ADB, charges it to 80% if below 40%, then powers the
   port back off.

Battery level is read from `/sys/class/power_supply/battery/capacity` over
ADB shell. This is the standard Linux power-supply class — `dumpsys` and
`getprop` are Android-only and not available on AsteroidOS.

## Requirements

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Python 3 | ≥ 3.9 | stdlib only; `python-systemd` optional for journald |
| [uhubctl](https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl) | any recent | for hub power control |
| adb | any | `android-tools` or `android-sdk-platform-tools` |
| fastboot | any | required for `flash`; same package as adb |
| wget | any | required for `flash` nightly downloads |
| [bottle](https://bottlepy.org/) | any recent | optional; required for `serve` (web UI) |

### Installing dependencies

**Arch Linux**
```sh
sudo pacman -S uhubctl android-tools
pip install bottle   # optional, for the web UI
```

**Debian / Ubuntu**
```sh
sudo apt install uhubctl android-tools-adb
pip install bottle   # optional, for the web UI
```

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/moWerk/asteroid-docking-bay.git
cd asteroid-docking-bay
./install.sh
```

The binary is installed to `~/.local/bin/asteroid-docking-bay`. The systemd
user units go to `~/.config/systemd/user/`.

`~/.local/bin` must be on your `PATH` for the short form to work. Most
distros add it automatically; if yours doesn't (the installer will warn you):
```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"   # add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
```

### Rootless setup (recommended)

By default uhubctl requires root. To run without sudo:

1. Find your hub's USB vendor ID:
   ```sh
   lsusb | grep -i hub
   # or
   uhubctl -l
   ```

2. Edit `udev/70-asteroid-docking-bay.rules` to uncomment the line matching
   your hub's vendor ID. Lenovo (`17ef`) and Realtek RTS5411 (`0bda`, common
   in 16-port hubs) are enabled by default and confirmed to do true per-port
   VBUS switching.

3. Install the rules:
   ```sh
   sudo cp udev/70-asteroid-docking-bay.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
   sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger --action=add
   # verify (no sudo): uhubctl -l   should now list your hub
   ```
   The rules grant access via `TAG+="uaccess"` (active local login seat) and
   `GROUP="users"` (for SSH/headless access). If your user is not in the
   `users` group, add yourself with `sudo usermod -aG users $USER` and log
   back in, or change the group in the rules file to one you are in. Earlier
   versions used `plugdev`, which many distros (Arch, EndeavourOS, Fedora) do
   not create, so the rule silently did nothing; `users` is the safer default.

   If a hub that is already plugged in does not pick up access after the
   trigger, unplug and replug its upstream cable once.

4. For ADB access (if not already configured):
   ```sh
   # Arch:
   sudo pacman -S android-udev
   # Other: copy udev/70-asteroid-docking-bay.rules and uncomment the ADB line
   ```

## Quick start

```sh
# Step 1: one-time hub setup — discovers hubs and tests per-port power switching
asteroid-docking-bay map

# Step 2: verify everything looks right
asteroid-docking-bay status

# Step 3: enable the automatic charging timer
systemctl --user enable --now asteroid-docking-bay-charge.timer
```

After the initial `map`, the **web UI handles everything else** — plugging in a
new watch, moving a watch to a different port, or adding a watch to a previously
empty slot. Click **Refresh** on any empty port row to detect and configure the
watch automatically (reads the codename from the device, tests PPPS, updates
config). No CLI intervention needed for day-to-day use.

## Commands

```
asteroid-docking-bay status
```
Show all configured watches with hub port, power state, ADB reachability, and
battery percentage.

```
asteroid-docking-bay on  <codename|all>
asteroid-docking-bay off <codename|all>
```
Power a port on or off. `off all` asks for confirmation unless `--force` is
passed.

```
asteroid-docking-bay cycle <codename|all> [--wait SEC]
```
Power off a port, wait (default: 5 s), power back on. Useful to hard-reset a
stuck watch.

```
asteroid-docking-bay charge <codename|all> [--duration MIN]
```
Manual one-time charge cycle: power on → wait for ADB → charge to
`high_threshold` (polling the battery, capped by `charge_max_minutes`) →
power off. `--duration MIN` forces a timed charge instead; watches whose
battery can't be read fall back to `charge_duration_minutes`.

```
asteroid-docking-bay check-charge
```
Periodic charge logic (same as what the timer runs). Safe to run manually for
testing. For each configured watch: wakes it, checks battery, and if below
`low_threshold` charges it to `high_threshold` before powering off.

```
asteroid-docking-bay map
```
One-time hub setup wizard:
1. Discovers all connected smart hubs.
2. Powers each port on in sequence and identifies the watch via ADB.
3. **Tests per-port power switching (PPPS)** with a live toggle (up to ~30 s
   per port — see `test-ports` below for what is verified).
4. Saves hub topology, port assignments, and serial numbers to config.

Run once when you first connect a hub, and again only if the hub itself
moves to a different USB port on the host. Adding or moving watches between
ports does not require re-running `map` — use **Refresh** in the web UI instead.
The switching test can be run independently with `test-ports`.

```
asteroid-docking-bay test-ports [codename]
```
Re-test per-port power switching for all configured ports (or a specific watch).
Updates the config and reports the verdict per port. Run this after moving a
watch to a different hub port, or if you skipped the test during `map`.

The test verifies that VBUS is **actually cut**, not just that the hub's
status register toggles (many hubs ACK the command while power stays live).
Evidence, strongest first: the device dropping off ADB within seconds of the
cut; if it keeps responding, the watch itself is asked whether it still sees
external power. Verdicts are three-way:

- `SMART` — VBUS cut confirmed by a live device
- `NOT SMART` — the device demonstrably kept external power through "off"
- `UNVERIFIED` — no device on the port to test against (empty port, or a
  watch that can't enumerate); re-run once a working watch is attached

A definitive verdict therefore requires a booted, ADB-visible watch on the
port. Expect up to ~30 s per port.

```
asteroid-docking-bay discover
```
Scan for ADB-connected watches and print their codename and serial. Useful for
finding serials after a new watch is connected.

```
asteroid-docking-bay serve [--host HOST] [--port PORT]
```
Start the web UI (requires `pip install bottle`). Serves a live status page at
`http://HOST:PORT/` (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`).

Each configured watch is shown as a table row. **Empty port rows** (no watch
assigned) show a **Refresh** button that triggers a full per-port remap: powers
the port on, waits for a watch, reads its codename, tests PPPS, and updates
config — all streamed live into an inline log below the row.

**Mapped watch rows** offer:

- **Refresh** — re-polls ADB state and battery level.
- **ON / OFF toggle** — switches hub port power; confirms the state changed.
- **⟳** — power-cycles the port (off → 5 s → on).
- **⏻ Halt** — submenu: graceful OS shutdown, reboot, or reboot to bootloader.
- **⚡ Charge** — charges to `high_threshold` (shown live as `⚡ 64% → 80%`),
  polling the battery every 2 minutes and stopping exactly at the target
  (capped by `charge_max_minutes`). Watches whose battery can't be read fall
  back to a fixed `charge_duration_minutes` countdown. A **◼ Stop charge**
  button is available while it runs.
- **📉 Drain test** — standby battery drain measurement: powers the port off
  and lets the watch run on battery, waking it every 30 minutes for a battery
  reading until it reaches 15% or you press **◼ Stop test**. The battery
  column shows the current level, drain rate (%/h), and estimated time to the
  floor. Results are saved as JSON to
  `~/.local/share/asteroid-docking-bay/drain-tests/`, and the **📉 drain
  history** link in the page header lists every recorded test — per-watch
  drain rate, estimated 100→15% standby life, and a wearability verdict. A
  rate that rises across months means battery wear.

  Each watch's latest drain result also annotates its battery column
  permanently: **⌚ ~3d** means the battery holds at least
  `wearable_min_hours` (default 24 h) of standby — wearable; **🪫 ~9h**
  marks a battery-swap candidate that's best kept as a dock-sustained dev /
  flash-test watch. This is the fleet triage view for aging collections:
  which watches still hold a day, and which only survive because the
  periodic charge keeps them in the 40–80% band.
- **🔧 Workbench** — check a watch out for hands-on work. The rig powers it
  up and then holds its battery in the low–high band for the whole session:
  charge to `high_threshold`, rest with the port off, re-check every
  `workbench_poll_minutes`, charge again at `low_threshold` — instead of a
  powered dock pegging the watch at 100% while you work. Do your work over
  WiFi/SSH (the USB link drops during rest phases); the rig's brief ADB
  battery reads don't interfere. If the battery can't be read (USB switched
  to RNDIS/SSH mode), it falls back to a blind duty cycle of
  `workbench_blind_charge_minutes` of power per rest period. **↩ Return**
  puts the watch back into the normal fleet, already inside the band.
  Charge, drain and flash actions refuse while a watch is checked out.
- **Flash nightly** — full nightly flash streamed live into the inline log.

The ADB column shows the AsteroidOS logo next to `device` when the watch is
detected running AsteroidOS; other watches show their detected OS instead
(e.g. `WearOS`) — handy for mixed collections that dock non-AsteroidOS
watches for battery care. Detection runs once per boot over ADB.

**Physical moves are followed automatically for booted watches.** Every
status refresh compares each ADB-online watch's real hub port (from sysfs)
against the config; when a watch has demonstrably moved — relocated to
another port, or swapped with another watch — the mapping updates itself
within one refresh cycle. Only booted, ADB-visible watches can be followed:
relocating a powered-off watch still needs a click on **Refresh** at its new
port. Each port also remembers the exact serial last seen there, so two
units of the same codename never answer for each other.

Charge and drain state live in the server, not the browser — reloading the
page (or opening it from another machine) picks up running operations and
their countdowns. On ports recorded as not power-switchable, the power
toggle, cycle, Charge and Drain buttons are disabled (Refresh, Halt and
Flash still work — they only need ADB).

The page auto-refreshes every 15 seconds. `--host 0.0.0.0` makes it
reachable from other machines on the network.

For persistent background operation, use the included systemd service:
```sh
# One-time setup
pip install bottle
systemctl --user enable --now asteroid-docking-bay-web.service
# → http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

```
asteroid-docking-bay flash [codename|all] [--local DIR] [--dry-run]
                                [--force-download] [--download-dir DIR]
```
Flash AsteroidOS nightlies to all configured watches (or a single codename) in
sequence, fully automated:

1. Downloads `zImage-dtb-{codename}.fastboot` and
   `asteroid-image-{codename}.rootfs.ext4` from
   `release.asteroidos.org/nightlies/{codename}/` and verifies SHA512. Already-
   downloaded files that pass the checksum are reused without re-downloading.
2. Powers on the hub port.
3. Waits for ADB. If the watch answers at `192.168.2.15` instead (SSH/RNDIS
   mode rather than ADB mode), it prints a prompt to switch to ADB mode in
   Settings → USB on the watch, then waits again.
4. `adb reboot bootloader`
5. Waits for a fastboot device to appear.
6. `fastboot flash userdata` + `fastboot flash boot` + `fastboot continue`
7. Removes stale `192.168.2.15` and `watch` entries from `~/.ssh/known_hosts`
   so the next SSH session isn't blocked by a key mismatch.

`--dry-run` prints the fastboot commands without executing them.  
`--local DIR` uses pre-built images from a local directory instead of
downloading.  
`--force-download` re-downloads even if the cached copy passes SHA512.  
`--download-dir DIR` overrides the default cache location
(`~/.local/share/asteroid-docking-bay/nightlies/`).

## Typical status output

```
WATCH             PORT            POWER  SMART  ADB             BATTERY
nemo              1-1:p1          ON     yes    device          67%
sparrow           1-1:p2          OFF    yes    --              --
dory              1-1:p3          ON     NO!    unauthorized    --
beluga            2-3.4:p2        ON     ?      offline         --
```

SMART column values:
- `yes` — per-port power switching confirmed by live test
- `NO!` — confirmed NOT switchable; on/off/cycle/charge have no effect
- `?`   — not yet tested; run `test-ports` to check

ADB states:
- `device` — fully authorized and online
- `unauthorized` — authorize the ADB connection on the watch screen
- `offline` — USB connected but ADB not yet ready (still booting, or sleeping)
- `--` — port is powered off or watch not recognized

## Configuration

Config is stored at `~/.config/asteroid-docking-bay/config.json`.
See `config.example.json` in this repo for a fully-annotated example.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `low_threshold` | `40` | Charge if battery is below this % |
| `high_threshold` | `80` | Power off if battery is at or above this % |
| `charge_duration_minutes` | `30` | Blind-mode charge duration (battery unreadable) |
| `charge_max_minutes` | `240` | Hard cap for a charge-to-target cycle |
| `wearable_min_hours` | `24` | Estimated standby (100→15%) above which a watch counts as wearable |
| `workbench_poll_minutes` | `30` | Workbench rest-phase re-check interval |
| `workbench_blind_charge_minutes` | `15` | Workbench charge burst per rest period when the battery is unreadable |
| `adb_wait_seconds` | `15` | Seconds between ADB availability retries |
| `adb_wait_retries` | `8` | Max retries (total wait: wait_seconds × retries) |
| `check_interval_hours` | `12` | Documentation only — actual interval is set in the systemd timer |
| `flash.nightly_url` | `https://release.asteroidos.org/nightlies` | Base URL for nightly image downloads |
| `flash.download_dir` | `~/.local/share/asteroid-docking-bay/nightlies` | Local cache for downloaded images |

The `check_interval_hours` field does **not** drive scheduling. Edit
`~/.config/systemd/user/asteroid-docking-bay-charge.timer` to change the
interval, then reload: `systemctl --user daemon-reload`.

## Systemd units

```

## Hardware notes

### Watches that require a physical power button press

Some AsteroidOS watches auto-boot when USB power is applied. Others require a
physical power button press. This tool cannot automate the latter — it will
power on the port, then wait for ADB, and log a warning with instructions if
the watch doesn't appear. You will need to press the button manually.

Known behavior by codename is not tracked here; check your watch's hardware
documentation or the AsteroidOS porting guide.

### Hub PPPS: data-line disconnect vs true VBUS switching

`uhubctl` marks a hub as `ppps` (per-port power switching) if it responds
to power commands. There are two very different hardware behaviours hiding
behind this label:

**True VBUS switching** — the hub physically gates the 5 V supply rail.
The watch loses both USB data and charging current. This is required for
battery management (the charge timer is useless without it).

**Data-line disconnect only** — the hub disconnects D+/D− so the device
stops enumerating on USB (`adb devices` drops, port shows `0000 off`), but
VBUS stays live and the watch keeps charging. This is what many cheap hubs
do, including ALCOR 05e3:0606 units.

`test-ports` distinguishes these automatically: it requires the device to
actually drop off the bus (or to report loss of external power over ADB)
before recording a port as smart — a toggling status register alone is not
accepted as evidence. To check manually: switch a port off with `uhubctl`,
then check whether the watch is still charging. If it is, the hub only
controls data lines.

Data-line-only hubs are still useful for ADB operations (flash, reboot,
bootloader) since those require a live USB data connection. They cannot
stop or control charging.

The [uhubctl compatible devices list](https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl#compatible-usb-hubs)
notes which hubs do true VBUS switching.

### Identifying smart hub ports

After `uhubctl -l` shows your hub location (e.g. `1-1`), plug in one watch at
a time and use `asteroid-docking-bay discover` to identify which serial
appeared. Then use `asteroid-docking-bay map` to assign the codename.

Alternatively, `uhubctl -l 1-1 -p 2 -a off` powers off port 2 on hub `1-1`;
if a watch disappears from `adb devices`, you have the right port.

### Multiple hubs

`uhubctl` identifies hubs by their USB location string (e.g. `1-1`, `2-3.4`).
These strings are stable as long as you plug hubs into the same physical ports.
If you rearrange cables, re-run `asteroid-docking-bay map`.

## Uninstall

```sh
./install.sh --uninstall
```

This removes the binary and systemd units. Config and serial mappings at
`~/.config/asteroid-docking-bay/` are preserved. Remove manually with
`rm -rf ~/.config/asteroid-docking-bay/`.
